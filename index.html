      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>The Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto declares that as technology improves the world head towards crypto-anarchy. In other words crypto graphics will be so precise that interactions and transactions that happen on the internet will be untrace able. This will mean:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People will be able to exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the legal identity of another person and keeping tehir identity a secret.</li>
        <li>Government regulation will be completely alterred. Taxation and controlling the economy will be difficult to do.</li>
        <li>The ability to keep information secret and even the nature of trust itself will be altered</li>
      </ul>
